In 1997 I started working on the [**PSEmu Pro**](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Software:PSEmu_Pro), the first and most consequential PlayStation emulator.

**PSEmu Pro** employed a DLL plugin system that allowed for external
collaboration and that was later on utilized as a base for more modern
emulators, such as *ePSXe*, hence my claim for **PSEmu Pro** being the most
consequential of the PlayStation emulators.

This was a non-commercial effort, done for the sake of the challenge
itself.

My initial involvement was writing the [GPU](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/graphicsprocessingunitgpu/) (Graphics Processing Unit) rendering emulation in software rendering.
I eventually joined the other two original developers (*Duddie* and *Tratax*), with the *Kazzuya* nickname.

Once in the team, I worked on anything necessary, most notably the
[GTE](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/geometrytransformationenginegte/) (Geometry Transformation Engine), and [MDEC](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/macroblockdecodermdec/) (Macroblock Decoder) emulation.  Constantly balancing between performance and accuracy.

I worked on this in my spare time, coordinating the effort online via IRC (Internet Relay Chat).

#### My work on the project

- GPU software rendering emulation
- GTE emulation, used for 3D math
- MDEC emulation, used for video MJPEG-like decoding
- Gamepad controller plugin

#### What I learned

- Details about the PlayStation hardware
- Working with a fully-remote team
- Optimization techniques for fixed-point math operations
- Optimization techniques for video decoding
