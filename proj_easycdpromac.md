In 1993 I worked on the Mac ("Macintosh" at the time) edition of *Easy-CD Pro*, the first CD burning software for the Mac.

Although by the time I've been developing in 'C' on the Mac for a while, this was the first commerical product with a relatively wide reach that I've worked on.

This was also my first experience working with the English language with a native speaker, when the programmer for the ISO image engine (originally built on a Sun workstation !) came to Rome to help us integrate his engine into the product.

#### My work on the project

- I wrote the user interface, including a tree-view of the filesystem
- Implemented conversion of file names from Mac long format to [ISO 9660](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660)
- Integrated the ISO image engine
- Various optimizations (file sorting. etc.)

#### What I learned

- CD burning software and formats
- Working in the context of an international team
