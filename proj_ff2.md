An arcade driving game for mobile with over 1M downloads.

[Final Freeway 2R](https://oykgames.com/final-freeway-2r/) (successor of [Final Freeway](https://oykgames.com/final-freeway/)), is an
arcade racing game for mobile phones that has reached a wide
distribution across multiple markets around the world.

It's built with and in-house game engine which I developed in C++ on top of
OpenGL ES. The game featues an unconventional presentation, common in the arcades of the 80s and early 90s.

#### My work on the project

I was the sole developer on this project except for the Android platform. The main tasks were:

- Writing the underlying game engine
- Writing the road model tuned to give a sense of speed and playability
- A simple stage definition format to simplify creation of new stages
- 3D audio based on OpenAL
- GUI system

#### What I learned

- Development on early iOS and Android NDK platforms
- Tuning for playability
- OpenGL ES optimization for various mobile targets
- API interfaces for various advertisement platforms
- Publishing and promotion of mobile games
