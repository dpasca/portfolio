#### Professional Journey

My journey into machine learning began in 2018 with the creation of a cryptocurrency trading system. By early 2023, my focus shifted towards Artificial Neural Networks, tackling increasingly complex tasks from autonomous driving to sophisticated time-series prediction models, now deployed in live trading.

In late 2023, I developed [ChatAI](https://github.com/dpasca/ChatAI), a virtual assistant integrating OpenAI's API. It features a hybrid of function calls and prompt injections for a seamless conversational experience. The assistant operates as a web app, leveraging Flask, Bootstrap, and additional tools for code and LaTeX rendering.

#### Insights Gained

Starting with fundamental concepts in Neural Networks was key to building a thorough understanding. A significant discovery was the superiority of Evolution Strategies (ES) over backpropagation for time-series prediction, although things may change with more research.

I also observed how factors like training data, network architecture, hyperparameters, and loss functions dramatically influence results. Developing a suitable loss function for time-series prediction is very much an art form, and such it requires a lot of experimentation to build intuition about what works and what doesn't.

At the technical level, I learned how to use PyTorch and LibTorch in C++ and I learned to optimize to reduce data transfer between CPU and GPU, a necessity when the evolutionary strategy is performed on the CPU.
