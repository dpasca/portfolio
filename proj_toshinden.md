In 1995 I worked on the PC port (MS-DOS) of [**Battle Arena Toshinden**](https://www.oddworld.com/oddworldgames/abes-oddysee/), a 3D fighting game and early PlayStation title.

For this port, we never received the full source code, so, much of the logic had to be written from scratch. My job was mostly writing the rendering engine, which had to run on regular Intel 486 and Pentium CPUs. I also wrote logic for the camera movement and some LAN network code (no Internet play yet !).

This was my first real job in the game industry, after a few years programming desktop software and developing 3D tech demos in my spare time (see RTMZ below).

A demo of the game is currently playable online at [oldgames.sk](https://online.oldgames.sk/play/dos/battle-arena-toshinden/10217) !

#### My work on the project

- Wrote a software rasterizer for the 3D characters and environment
- Basic UI for options and main screen
- Logic for camera and controls

#### What I learned

- First steps into actual game development, albeit from a technical perspective
